environments === where the app is running
    -where the database is running is the environment
    - if prev running version 10 of node and then you upgrade to 11, 
        thats two diff environments, because things running on 10

    -localhost would be environment on your computer, while heroku is
        an online environment. 
         -if running on your computer (localhost) it's a dev environment
         -heroku is a production environment
    -development === your computer
    -staging/test === server similar to production
    -production === strong server(s) somewhere
heroku === when using heroku must make port dynamic because heroku assigns the port
